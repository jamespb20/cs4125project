Please follow the steps below: If the system keeps displaying a message indicating that the app is being installed, delete the downloaded app package or terminate the download task and try to install the app again. To delete the app package, open HUAWEI AppGallery, go to Me > Installation packages, and delete the package in question. To terminate the download task, open HUAWEI AppGallery, go to Me > Installation manager, and touch the download progress bar on the right of the app in question. Clear the cache of HUAWEI AppGallery and try to install the app from HUAWEI AppGallery again. (Refer to Step 4 in What should I do if I can't download an app in HUAWEI AppGallery? ) Check whether PrivateSpace has been enabled (by going to Settings > Privacy > PrivateSpace) or whether a sub user has been created (by going to Settings > Users & accounts). If so, disable it and try to install the app in question again. Restart your device, connect it to another network, and try to download and install the app again. The cause of '103 No certificate found' is the app may not be compatible with the device system. The suggestion in the FAQ is 'When you search for the app, check whether there is a tag indicating whether the app is compatible with your device.
